    <h2>The Bicultural Society of New Zealand</h2>
    <p>New Zealand’s population is made up of many different cultures, but our most dominant cultures are those of Māori and
    Pākehā. Ever since the Treaty of Waitangi, this country has united both Māori and English people as one, allowing New
    Zealanders to see and acknowledge both sides of their heritage. Both the English and Māori languages are widely used
    across the country, some schools offering to teach Māori in classes. Throughout the years, however, the preservation of
    Māori culture has become less important to New Zealand’s society. More people have been standing up for their heritage,
    urging the government to respect their culture and protect the country’s bi-culturalism.</p>

    <h2>The Treaty of Waitangi</h2>
    <p>Since the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi on February 6th, 1840, Māori and Pākehā have inhabited New Zealand together,
    united by the British Crown’s partnership with Māori. English settlers had been living in New Zealand since the early
    19th century, and by 1839 the European population had increased to 2,000. By that time, the British government had
    decided it was time to take action, sending William Hobson to represent the British Crown. The treaty, written by Hobson
    and James Busby, was presented at Waitangi on February 5th to both Māori and Pākehā, and was discussed throughout the
    day. Since the treaty was hastily translated, there were a few differences between the English and Māori versions, but
    the signing still proceeded on the 6th. The treaty is still respected today and plays a part in New Zealand’s culture.
    The Government strives to stand by the agreements made in the treaty in order to work towards a better and more unified
    country, embracing both Māori and Pākehā cultures.</p>

    <h2>Relation to the IT Industry</h2>
    <p>Māori people are present in all kinds of job industries in New Zealand, and have been using the internet and working in
    technological fields alongside Pākehā for a very long time. While most IT companies have been increasing their efforts
    to create a more diverse work environment, this industry still needs to work on their inclusivity and acceptance.
    Experiences of Māori working in tech have been mixed, some encountering major issues within their workplaces while
    others have no difficulty fitting in. Some organisations have focused too much on superficial diversity such as
    ethnicity or gender rather than diversity of thought processes and personality, trying to fill a quota instead of truly
    caring about inclusivity. Other issues have been encountered in the world of technology, such as difficulty displaying
    the Māori language and proper use of Māori content and information, both of which have been worked on and greatly
    improved over time.</p>

    <h2>New Zealand’s Bicultural Society: How does it Affect IT?</h2>
    <p>New Zealand has a lot of diversity within its population, and is generally considered a bicultural society, primarily
    represented by Māori and Pākehā people. This society is present in all sectors of the country, including the industry of
    Information Technology. There has been a constant push for diversity within organisations and equality for Māori using
    the internet as well as those working in IT. While Māori have been utilising the internet in many different ways, they
    have encountered many technical and social issues along the way.</p>
